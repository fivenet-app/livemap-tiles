# livemap-tiles

Pre-generated livemap tiles generated from the Virus_City Postal Code Map based on the DLK HD Atlas Map (links to resources and authors in [credits section](#credits)).

These are generated leaflet tiles ready to be used with FiveNet's livemap feature. They have been generated using a customized `gdal2tiles` version from [GitHub commenthol/gdal2tiles-leaflet](https://github.com/commenthol/gdal2tiles-leaflet) to work with Leaflet.

To note the postal code map image file had been scaled up to a resolution of 16384x16384 before being run through `gdal2tiles`.
